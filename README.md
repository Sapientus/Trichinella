# THIS IS A SARCASTIC PARODY FOR AN APP

If you are a random developer who got unlucky to see my sh#t and now is going to write bad comments, don't worry I dislike this app even more than you.

Yeah, I'm my the biggest hater, let's befriend :)

Actually I'm planning to do something else so I decided not to waste my time and energy doing apps which I won't use.

Do you remember my desire to write a novel in READMEs just from boring and pain inside? I decided to make an app where I will post chapters so others will be able to read it in more comfortable conditions.

So I'm quite busy these days.

\*You can use run this masterpiece of mine just running "main.py", it lacks frontend part so you can see Swagger adding "/docs" to url.
